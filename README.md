## What is TypeScript?

- JavaScript and More
    TS adds additional syntax to JS to support a tighter integation with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor. 


- A Result You Can Trust
    TS code converts to JS which runs anywhere JS runs.

- Safety at Scale
    TS understands JS and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.
